# ParkingLot
Parking Lot Automation in Golang

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes, and will help you go through how to run and see the results of the project.

### Prerequisites

The only prerequisite to run this project is a linux machine with golang installed in it. I used golang v1.8 to develop this.
